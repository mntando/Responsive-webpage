## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I found out that in css you can add conditions for the size of the screen. This is a great way to make your website responsive.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {    
    .main {
        height: 90%;
        width: 87%;
    }
    ...
}
```

### Continued development

- Correct padding and margin
- Correct positioning of elements
- Correct overflow
